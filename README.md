# Getting and Cleaning Data Project
## Final project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course

The script ('run_analysis.R') uploads all the relevant files (for the scope of the analysis) located in the working directory. Relevant files are: 
 - X_test.txt
 - y_test.txt
 - subject_test.txt 
 - X_train.txt
 - y_train.txt
 - subject_train.txt 

After the uploading, the script performs the analysis for the creation of a tidy data set. 

At the end the script allows the export of the tidy data set (in '.txt' format) to the working directory.
